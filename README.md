# Tableau-Dashboard-Covid-Analysis

In this project, I've utilized SQL to conduct thorough data exploration, analyzing and extracting valuable insights from the dataset. Additionally, I will be leveraging Tableau to create compelling visualizations that effectively communicate the findings and patterns uncovered through the data analysis. This combination of SQL for data manipulation and Tableau for visualization will enable me to provide a comprehensive and visually engaging exploration of the data, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying trends and relationships within the dataset.
